It provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline and accelerate the creation of ML models, saving valuable development time while offering advanced Data Science functionality. Initially developed as [Inner Source](https://www.bbvaaifactory.com/mercury-acelerando-la-reutilizacion-en-ciencia-de-datos-dentro-de-bbva/), several modules of Mercury have been released as open source.\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates how easily you can use Mercury to enhance your ML workflows. Whether you're validating datasets, running robust tests, explaining models, or monitoring data drift, Mercury provides an effective solution for each task. In this notebook, we will explore the following modules:\n","\n","- **mercury-dataschema**: Ensures consistency by validating whether different datasets conform to the same schema.\n","- **mercury-robust**: Provides robust testing for ML models and datasets, ensuring reliability.\n","- **mercury-explainability**: Offers tools to interpret ML models, helping you understand model decisions.\n","- **mercury-monitoring**: Monitors models and data in production environments, detecting issues such as data drift.\n","\n","## Why Use Mercury?\n","\n","By leveraging Mercury, you'll experience:\n","\n","- **Ease of use**: Its intuitive modular design allow seamless integration into your projects.\n","- **Faster development**: Pre-built components let you focus on building models rather than on redundant tasks.\n","- **Advanced functionality**: Gain access to tools for [schema validation](https://bbva.github.io/mercury-dataschema), [model explainability](https://bbva.github.io/mercury-explainability), [event sequence analysis](https://bbva.github.io/mercury-reels), [subset querying](https://bbva.github.io/mercury-settrie), [monitoring](https://bbva.github.io/mercury-monitoring) of models and data, and [robust testing](https://bbva.github.io/mercury-robust).\n","\n","## Try it Yourself!\n","\n","Explore the code below and modify it to fit your specific use cases.
