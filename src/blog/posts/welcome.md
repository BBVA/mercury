# Welcome to the Mercury Blog!

Welcome to the Mercury library blog! We're thrilled to introduce you to Mercury, a Python library for Machine Learning and Data Science that began as an inner-source project within [BBVA](https://www.bbva.es/en/).

<!-- more -->

Created to streamline code sharing among our global tech teams, Mercury aimed to enhance collaboration and code quality through community involvement. This initiative not only improved our code but also nurtured a culture of knowledge sharing and teamwork. Going open-source is more than just sharing code â€” it's about embracing transparency and contributing to the open-source community that has been instrumental in our success. We invite you to explore, provide feedback, and contribute to Mercury's growth!
