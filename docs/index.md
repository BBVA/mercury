### Use it and contribute!

This library was originally an Inner Source project at BBVA, but now some assets are open-source! We welcome everyone to use and contribute to the library: together, we can improve it and make it more useful.

### Powered by ML experts

We work to ensure that Mercury continues to grow and release new assets. The Mercury core team maintains the library updated and proactively develops new functionalities.

# Mercuryâ€™s Micro-Repositories

Mercury is structured with multiple micro-repositories in a highly modular design. These packages are available on Github, where you will also find installation instructions, documentation, and examples of how to use the library. Each repository is independent, but some have interdependencies. For example, mercury-robust uses mercury-dataschema and mercury-monitoring underneath.

# Mercury Strengths

Each Mercury component brings something new or offers clear advantages over other available analytical solutions. The modules are functional and production-ready, and they are designed as pieces of code that are not tied to specific business cases, so anyone can use them.

### From small utilities to complete frameworks

Some packages are designed to solve specific Data Science tasks, while others offer a diverse collection of Machine Learning functionalities through a unified API.

### High-quality components

Every function or class in Mercury has been thoroughly tested and documented by a dedicated core team from BBVA. The library is production-ready, meaning that it has been designed for deploying ML models in real-world environments. Additionally, tutorials are provided to facilitate the adoption of the library.
