# Mercury GitHub Pages

The site sources are in English (`src/en` and `mkdocs.en.yml`) and Spanish (`src/es` and `mkdocs.es.yml`). Execute **`bash serve.sh`** to build both subsites (into `docs`) and start a development server with which to preview them (`mkdocs serve` can only be configured with one `mkdocs.yml` and thus can only be used to preview one subsite).
